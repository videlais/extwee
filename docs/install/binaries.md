# Binaries

Either by downloading the `extwee` (or `extwee.exe`) files from the [Releases listing](https://github.com/videlais/extwee/releases) or from the `build` folder, Extwee can be used as a stand-alone command-line program. (Currently, only builds for MacOS and Windows are included.)

## CLI Example

```bash
extwee.exe -c -i <tweeFile> -s <storyFormat> -o <Twine2HTML>
```
